/**
 * Allows the agent to explicitly skip its turn.
 *
 * This tool should be invoked by the LLM when the user indicates they would like
 * to think or take a short pause before continuing the conversationâ€”e.g. when
 * they say: "Give me a second", "Let me think", or "One moment please".  After
 * calling this tool, the assistant should not speak until the user speaks
 * again, or another normal turn-taking condition is met.  The tool itself has
 * no parameters and performs no side-effects other than informing the backend
 * that the current turn generation is complete.
