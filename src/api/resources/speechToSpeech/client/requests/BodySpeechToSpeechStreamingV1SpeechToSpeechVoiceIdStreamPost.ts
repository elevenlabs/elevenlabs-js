     * You can turn on latency optimizations at some cost of quality. The best possible final latency varies by model. Possible values:
     * 0 - default mode (no latency optimizations)
     * 1 - normal latency optimizations (about 50% of possible latency improvement of option 3)
     * 2 - strong latency optimizations (about 75% of possible latency improvement of option 3)
     * 3 - max latency optimizations
     * 4 - max latency optimizations, but also with text normalizer turned off for even more latency savings (best latency, but can mispronounce eg numbers and dates).
