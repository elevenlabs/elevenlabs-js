```ts
import { ElevenLabsClient, play } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Defaults to process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
});

const audio = await elevenlabs.textToSpeech.convert("Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2", {
    text: "Hello! ‰Ω†Â•Ω! Hola! ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á! Bonjour! „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ! ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß! ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî! Ciao! Cze≈õƒá! –ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç! ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç!",
    modelId: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
});

await play(audio);
```

</details>

‚ö†Ô∏è elevenlabs-js requires [MPV](https://mpv.io/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to play audio.

## üó£Ô∏è Voices

List all your available voices with `search()`.

```ts
import { ElevenLabsClient } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Defaults to process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
});

const voices = await elevenlabs.voices.search();
```

For information about the structure of the voices output, please refer to the [official ElevenLabs API documentation for Get Voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices).

## üöø Streaming

Stream audio in real-time, as it's being generated.

```ts
const audioStream = await elevenlabs.textToSpeech.stream("JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb", {
    text: "This is a... streaming voice",
    modelId: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
});

stream(audioStream);
```

## Retries

This Node SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be
retried as long as the request is deemed retriable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger
than the configured retry limit (default: 2).

A request is deemed able to retry when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [409](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/409) (Conflict)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

```ts
const response = await elevenlabs.voices.search(
    {},
    {
        maxRetries: 2, // Set the maximum number of retries
    },
);
```

## Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to
configure this behavior.

```ts
const response = await elevenlabs.voices.search(
    {},
    {
        timeoutInSeconds: 30, // override timeout to 30s
    },
);
```

## Runtime compatiblity

The SDK defaults to `node-fetch` but will use the global fetch client if present. The SDK
works in the following runtimes:

The following runtimes are supported:

- Node.js 15+
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+

## Elevenlabs Namespace

All of the ElevenLabs models are nested within the `ElevenLabs` namespace.

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
